## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. API Testing with VS Code
1. Install REST Client extension for VS Code
2. Open files in `tests/` folder:
   - `auth-service.http` - Test authentication endpoints
   - `product-service.http` - Test product CRUD operations

### 2. Manual Testing Flow
1. **Login**: POST to `/api/auth/login` with admin credentials
2. **Copy JWT token** from response
3. **Test products**: Use token in Authorization header
4. **Create products**: POST to `/api/products`
5. **List products**: GET from `/api/products`

## 📚 API Endpoints Overview

### Auth Service (`http://localhost:5001`)
```
POST   /api/auth/login          # User login
GET    /api/auth/me             # Get current user
POST   /api/auth/refresh        # Refresh JWT token
POST   /api/auth/logout         # Logout user
POST   /api/auth/revoke-all     # Revoke all tokens
GET    /health                  # Health check
```

### Product Service (`http://localhost:5002`)
```
GET    /api/products            # List products (paginated)
GET    /api/products/{id}       # Get product by ID
POST   /api/products            # Create new product
PUT    /api/products/{id}       # Update product
DELETE /api/products/{id}       # Delete product (Admin only)
GET    /health                  # Health check
```

## 🔄 Next Steps (TODO Items)

- [ ] Audit log query APIs
- [ ] Real-time audit tracking

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] React admin panel with NextUI
- [ ] User management interface
- [ ] Product management UI
- [ ] License management dashboard
- [ ] Audit log viewer

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🔧 Architecture Decisions Made

### Security
- **JWT tokens** with 1-hour expiration
- **Refresh tokens** with 7-day expiration
- **BCrypt** password hashing with automatic salting
- **Role-based access control** throughout all services
- **CORS** configuration for frontend integration

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL** as primary database for consistency
- **Soft delete** patterns for data integrity
- **EF Core** with code-first migrations
- **Proper indexing** on email and name/version combinations

### Performance
- **Redis caching** for user sessions and frequently accessed data
- **Pagination** for large data sets
- **Connection pooling** with Npgsql
- **Async/await** patterns throughout

### Observability
- **Structured logging** with Serilog
- **Health check endpoints** for monitoring
- **Request/response logging** middleware
- **Error handling** with proper HTTP status codes

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps postgres

# Restart if needed
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart postgres
```

### JWT Token Issues
- Verify JWT secret is at least 32 characters
- Check token expiration times in configuration
- Ensure Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`

### Build Issues
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
dotnet clean
dotnet build

# Restore packages
dotnet restore
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Expected Performance (Local Development)
- **Authentication**: ~50-100ms per request
- **Product queries**: ~20-50ms per request
- **Database operations**: ~10-30ms per query
- **Redis operations**: ~1-5ms per operation

### Scalability Considerations
- Each service is **stateless** and horizontally scalable
- **Database connection pooling** handles concurrent requests
- **Redis caching** reduces database load
- **JWT tokens** eliminate server-side session storage

## 🎯 Production Readiness

### What's Production-Ready
✅ Authentication and authorization system
✅ Database schema and migrations
✅ Configuration management
✅ Error handling and logging
✅ Health check endpoints
✅ Docker containerization

### What Needs Production Setup
🔧 Environment-specific configuration
🔧 SSL/TLS certificates
🔧 Database backup strategy
🔧 Monitoring and alerting
🔧 Load balancing configuration
🔧 Security hardening
