## ðŸ“¦ Deployment Architecture

* All services are containerized using Docker.
* Each service has its own Helm chart for K8s deployment.
* Configuration managed via Secrets and ConfigMaps.
* GitHub Actions handles CI (build/test) and CD (deploy).
* PostgreSQL and Redis deployed as stateful workloads.
* Optional: External MongoDB or Elasticsearch if audit logging is enabled.

ðŸ‘Š This architecture supports modular scaling, observability, CI/CD, and is cloud-native by design. Ready for SaaS or self-hosted licensing.
